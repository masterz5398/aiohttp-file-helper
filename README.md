# Aiohttp File Drive 

This was made for personal use primarily and I 
thought let others also use it, so I made this repo
public it has minimal functionality.

It was created for transferring files across devices.

You can use this code make forks add functionality too.

You can also add functionality and make a pull request, I will check and merge it to master branch _IF IT HELPS MAKE THE PROGRAM BETTER_

this is a minimal implementation and not a full-fledged implementation.
But I am willing to make changes when someone requests a feature **WHEN I HAVE TIME**


<u>**_CURRENT STATUS :_**</u>
<ul>
<li>
The aiohttp server file needs to be updated
</li>
<li>The __fast_api__.py is working perfectly</li>
</ul>

<u>**_Using :_**</u>
<ol>
<li>
you can run it on local and use it on LAN (it has been tested on vercel and was not working)
</li>
<li>
you can visit the hosted site and you can see the functions(upload, delete, open)
</li>
</ol>
note:

you may stream mp4 and some other files but you will not be able to skip to parts and skipping will play the video from the start
