# Aiohttp File Drive 

This was made for personal use primarily and I 
thought let others also use it, so I made this repo
public it has minimal functionality and protection (just a password).

It was created for transferring files across devices.

You can use this code make forks add functionality too.

You can also add functionality and make a pull request, I will check and merge it to master branch _IF IT HELPS MAKE THE PROGRAM BETTER_

this is a minimal implementation and not a full-fledged implementation.
But I am willing to make changes when someone requests a feature **WHEN I HAVE TIME**
